# Deliverables

- A notebook containing your analysis, i.e. the work that you did to get to the conclusions and predictions mentioned above.

- A tidied data set. The source data is a little messy and there is some work that needs to be done before you can effectively work with it. Your notebook should include the code to go from the original source data to a data set that you can work with.

- A summarization of the data.

- What do you make of the data? What can you say say about the individual who was wearing this fitness tracker?

- Predictions for the missing two weeks worth of data in a separate csv file.

- The above information distilled into two slides that can be shared with a general audience. Include at least one visualization, and make sure that the visualization is clearly labeled.
