# Fitbit Time Series Project

## About the Project
For this project we will be using machine learning time series methodologies 

## Goals


## Deliverables
- A notebook containing your analysis, i.e. the work that you did to get to the conclusions and predictions mentioned above.
- A tidied data set. The source data is a little messy and there is some work that needs to be done before you can effectively work with it. Your notebook should include the code to go from the original source data to a data set that you can work with.
- A summarization of the data.
- What do you make of the data? What can you say say about the individual who was wearing this fitness tracker?
- Predictions for the missing two weeks worth of data in a separate csv file.
- The above information distilled into two slides that can be shared with a general audience. Include at least one visualization, and make sure that the visualization is clearly labeled.

## Initial Thoughts & Hypothesis
### Thoughts
- Time series should be a useful tool to answer this question

### Hypothesis
- Null hypothesis:  
- Alternative hypothesis: 

## Project Steps
### Acquire
- Data is aquired from the fitbit-data files.
- The functions are stored in the acquire.py file.
- File is a reproducible component for gathering the data.

### Prepare
- Created a prepare.py file. 
- Data is split into train, validate, and test. 
- Data is scaled as necessary.
- Missing values are investigated and handled.
- Outliers are investigated and handled.
- File is a reproducible component that handles missing values, outliers, and changes in data types. 

### Explore
- Summarized your takeaways and conclusions.  

### Model

### Conclusion

### Future Investigations
